      <div class = "resume-header">Summary</div>
      <div class = "resume-content">I am a web developer who recently graduated from Colgate University where I minored in computer science. While there I took classes in Python, Java, Hascal, C, and Ruby (in both a Sinatra framework and Rails framework). I was on track to enter into the financial industry but found myself becoming more involved and invested in my coding classes. Â About a week before graduating I decided to attend a hands on immersive web developer boot camp in order to prepare more for entering the tech industry. Now I am looking forward to contributing to the tech industry by building meaningful software.</div>
