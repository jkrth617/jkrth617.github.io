	<div>Hi</div>
	<div>My name is Jake. I am web developer looking for new opportunities to utilize and polish my craft. I just graduated from <a href="#">Dev BootCamp(DBC)</a> where I learned about object oriented principles, good general practices, and web frameworks. The language focus at DBC was Ruby. I focused on using Ruby's methods to write clean and readable code. <span class = "content-important">As a programer I strive to write eloquent and concise programs so that others will be able to read and build off my logic</span>. Nothing bothers me more than reading through someone else's code and getting lost in 'x' variables or circuitous logic or, my least favorite, massive methods doing way more than they should. I try to stick to writing small methods that accomplish one task. This was my programs are readable and easy to expand/debug. Also at DBC I learned about Rails, Javascript, HTML, CSS, jQuery, SQL, a Git workflow, and other general coding practices. Prior to DBC I was at Colgate University where I minored in computer Science. That is where I was first exposed to programing. Ever since then I really fell in love with programing and the coderâ€™s mentality. I now look at technology, or think or ideas and feel the drive to create them. From silly applications that my friends talk about, to what ultimately became my final project at DBC. At DBC I, along with three others, created <a href="#">SoapStone</a>, a social media app that encourages its users to go out into their world. The process of watching my idea go from random thoughts to existing in my phone was an amazing experience. <span class = "content-important">As I go out in search of a career I want to find a job where I can really feel passionate about the code I am writing and make it my own.</span></div>
